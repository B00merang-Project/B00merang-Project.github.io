We believe in the free and open-source software philosophy and therefore release most of our work under the [GNU Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), with a few exceptions covered here:
- The Solaris 11 theme is under dual license (GPLv3 and [LGPLv2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.0.en.html) so that it can be used in [OpenIndiana](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/nimbus/tree/oi/hipster/gtk-engine/gtk-3.0)
- Windows Longhorn themes may include proprietary assets, as the origin of the images used is unkown. We plan on recreating most of them to remove the risk.

**Most theme should include a license file in the Git repository. If not, please let us know**

# On copyright
Some names used are under trademark (ex. Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, etc.) are used for reference purposes only. No infringement is intended.
