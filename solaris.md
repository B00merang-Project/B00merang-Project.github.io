Solaris, much like everything Oracle touches, is slowly dying

### Before Oracle
Solaris (previously SunOS) was the system that came with Sun's SPARC servers and was relatively successful

### After Oracle
Yes, Solaris 11 came out before the Oracle acquisition, but I'm putting it here to keep a semblant of symmetry in the page
