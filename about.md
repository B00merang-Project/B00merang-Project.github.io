We're a group of developers making themes for a variety of desktop environments. We've been active since 2015, when we published a very barebones Windows 10 theme.

The primary goal of this project is to develop and maintain themes based on old-school designs, and bring them to modern platforms. Occasionally, we do our own themes too.

We mostly suport GNOME, Cinnamon and Xfce desktops, with some support for LXDE and Unity. We'd like to support as many environments as possible, but we have to find a balance between complexity and availability.

The tools we use to develop themes can be [found here](), and we have a tutorial to get started with them [here]().

As most of the developers on this project have their own business to tend to, we occasionally go on extended breaks, but we intend on keeping the project going for the forseeable future.
